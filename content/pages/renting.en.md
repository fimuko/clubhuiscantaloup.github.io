<!-- # Renting -->

Cantaloup Clubhouse is a multifunctional space that can be rented for various (cultural) activities for both adults and children. In the past years the clubhouse was used for example: by theater groups (as a space for practice); for art classes for children and for the meetings of the "seniors club". From 1 January 2025, the Clubhouse can be rented on weekends (from 10:00 to 14:00 and from 14:00 to 18:00) by the community members of the neighborhood for small-scale children's parties or other activities. Please note: the playground closes at 18:00. Cleaning up the Clubhouse must also take place during the rented part of the day.

Rent per part of the day: €100,-
